                Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by 
                Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts.

                Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads 
                of three players using pre-made characters with distinctive abilities, 
                called "Legends", similar to those of hero shooters.[1] Alternate modes 
                have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since 
                the game's release. The game is free-to-play and monetized through 
                microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real 
                money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends 
                and new colors for weapons.

                Each new season is intended to bring with it the release of a new playable character, usually new weapons and purchasable cosmetic items.</br>
                The game's first season started on March 19, 2019. Associated with seasons are time-limited 
                battle passes that reward players with new cosmetic items, should they complete in-game 
                challenges during the season. [11, 12, 13(latest Season 10 May, 2022)] Alongside new cosmetic 
                items, seasons can also bring changes to the map and additional gameplay elements.

                In addition to the season contents, Apex Legends features limited-time events. 
                These events offer unique, limited-time cosmetics themed to the event 
                (for example, in the case of the Holo-Day Bash, Christmas-themed outfits) 
                that can be earned in-game.[39] Events also provide unique limited-time game 
                modes (such as shotguns and snipers only). Some events also introduced changes 
                to the current season map with a new point of interest (known as a "Town Takeover"), 
                which is themed around one of the legends.

                Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest 
                game hunters the Frontier has ever seen. The child of two engineers 
                stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was 
                taken in by their uncle Artur after a meltdown destroyed the facility 
                and killed both their parents. Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief 
                system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. 
                Yet Bloodhound was constantly drawn to technological marvels, and ultimately 
                used both new and old methods to take down a Goliath that preyed on the people 
                of their village, forever changing their life’s path.

            Gibraltar is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two SARAS 
            (Search and Rescue Association of Solace) volunteers, he has always 
            been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common 
            in the Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of 
            protecting others when he and his boyfriend stole his father’s motorcycle, 
            took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His parents 
            saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Gibraltar has never 
            forgotten that sacrifice and has devoted his life to helping those in need.</br> <br>
            The Apex Games didn’t change that, but they changed what it meant.
            Many of Gibraltar’s friends and colleagues have competed in the Games 
            for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, and some never came home. 
            Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, his skills as a 
            rescuer and his rebellious nature worked together. He’s now become an icon 
            in the Apex Games, putting himself in the line of fire to protect his squad 
            and send his opponents running for cover.

                With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his creator.

                spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality — but those abilities 
                came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with 
                no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered 
                as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked 
                her away… no longer existed. All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a 
                cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and 
                taught her to listen to the voices. Following her lead, Wraith found the strength 
                to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.

                Dedicated to the IMC cause, she was top of her class at the IMC Military Academy and

                could begin the decades-long trip back home. Now, she fights to raise money in the

                he perfected the art of fooling around to get attention. The one thing he took

                about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and 
                his mother continued to develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer.<br> <br>
                While working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage heard amazing stories from 
                his patrons about the Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. 
                As good as both of those sounded, he knew he couldn’t risk leaving his mother 
                childless – until she gave him a set of customized holo devices and told him to

               One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Son of the preoccupied 
               CEO of Silva Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by 
               performing death-defying stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. 
               So, this day, he decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching 
               himself across the finish line – using a grenade.<br><br>
               As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his 
               legs meant his daredevil days were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned 
               to an old friend for help: <a class="main-section" href="#Lifeline">Ajay Che,</a> who he guilted into forging an order to replace his 
               legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment’s notice, Octavio 
               decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate adrenaline rush, the Apex Games, 
               was calling. Now, he’s going to become an Apex Champion doing the most incredible, death-defying 
               moves anyone’s ever seen. Maybe in the arena, he won’t be so bored.

                Natalie “Wattson” Paquette is a familiar face in the Apex Games, though for a

                she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and discovered her calling at a 
                young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and hyper-focused 
                the next, electricity grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense 
                in a way the rest of the world didn’t.<br><br>
                She devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such 
                a skilled engineer that she was commissioned to build the Apex Games’ Modified 
                Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her father died the day it was revealed, 
                leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors invited her 
                to return to the arena with them, assuring her she would always have a home. 
                She now fights alongside her friends in the arena she helped build, destroying 
                incoming missiles, recharging shields, creating fences, and using her pylon to 
                silence fights that get too loud. Nobody knows the arena better than Wattson – anyone 
                who underestimates her is in for a shock.

            Crypto specializes in secrets. A brilliant hacker and encryption expert, he uses 
            aerial drones to spy on his opponents in the Apex Arena without being seen. He 
            also has a secret of his own: his name is Tae Joon Park, and he joined the Apex 
            Games to find the people who framed him for murder.<br><br>
            An orphan abandoned at a young age, Tae Joon escaped a life of squalor by becoming 
            a computer engineer for the Mercenary Syndicate, along with his foster sister, 
            Mila Alexander. One day, Tae Joon and Mila stumbled upon an algorithm that could 
            predict the result of any Apex Games match, hidden away in the Games’ own computer 
            systems. That caught the attention of the wrong people - the next day, Mila disappeared, 
            and Tae Joon was forced to into hiding after he was framed for her murder. He’s now joined 
            the Games to clear his name - because sometimes the spotlight is the best place to hide.

            Revenant used to be human. He used to be the greatest hitman the Mercenary Syndicate 
            ever had. He used to look in the mirror and see his human face looking back. But time 
            changes everything, and when his programming finally failed, he saw what he had become 
            at the hands of the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond Robotics: a walking nightmare of steel 
            and vestigial flesh. His masters resurrected him as a simulacrum, snatching him from death’s 
            embrace again and again and programming him to forget.<br><br>
            He swore he would hunt down every last person who did this to him, but more than two 
            centuries have passed, and they're all gone… or so he thought. The return of Hammond Robotics 
            to the Outlands has renewed his thirst for vengeance, and he won’t stop until anybody connected 
            to Hammond is dead. Of course, he doesn’t mind eviscerating a few of the Legends along the way. 
            He used to need a reason to kill… but he’s not that man anymore.

                When Loba was nine, she looked on as simulacrum hitman Revenant killed her family. 
                Left with nothing, Loba survived by picking pockets. As her skills improved, Loba 
                used every tool at her disposal to lift herself from the gutter. Everything changed 
                when she broke into a supposedly impenetrable facility and got her hands on the Jump 
                Drive tech stored inside. With her new teleportation bracelet, the most secure and 
                unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living the high life.<br><br>
                Rumors spread across the Outlands: if you wanted something valuable -and well 
                guarded- Loba’s who you go to. She was almost able to put her past behind her. 
                But when Revenant joined the Games, her past catapulted into her future. Desperate 
                to find a way to kill him, she sabotaged a facility full of Revenant bodies, 
                bringing Skull Town and Thunderdome crashing down in the process. However, she 
                learned it was just one of many such factories hidden across the Frontier. Now, 
                she’s joined the Games to find a way to end him for good. It doesn’t hurt that 
                the Arenas are brimming with treasures just waiting to be plucked. <br><br>
                Revenge will come, if fortune favors her. In the meantime, some shiny things have caught her eye.

                full of scrap metal to get by in the dangerous, wild west world of the Outlands. Before 
                opening her popular modding shop on Gaea, Ramya Parekh (Rampart for short) made a name 
                for herself in the underground gauntlet circuit. Parekh climbed to the top showcasing 
                pure skill using her custom-modded gear. She began taking jobs from smugglers, Syndicate 
                members, and everyone in between. Some say it ain’t great unless it’s got “Rampart” written on it.<br><br>
                Parekh never shied away from letting people know how great she was, or better yet, how 
                bad they were. Maybe that’s what led a group of assailants to ambush her at her shop 
                one night. Her business burned down and she was left with nothing -- except an Apex 
                Card. For Parekh, the Apex card is more than just an invitation to compete - it's a 
                sign that she may have lost her shop, but she didn't lose what built it. Like her motto 
                says, she's the kind of person who can always "turn crap into gold.”

                Fuse grew up on Salvo--a brutal planet ruled by a rotating collection of misfit warlords

                and beloved gladiator on the planet. But he itched to join the grandest stage of them all: the Apex Games.
                 While Salvo remained a part of Independent Space that dream was impossible, but once they joined the Syndicate, 
                 his chance arrived. It came at a price, however -- Maggie wouldn’t let him go without a fight.

                Lamont Craig wasn’t like other dads in the neighborhood. Sure, he dropped the kids off at 
                school and acted out multiple voices every night for Story Time with his toddler. 
                But Lamont had secrets—the first being his real name, Jackson Williams.<br><br>
                A top soldier for the IMC, Jackson went AWOL when he ignored direct orders to fight 
                what he believed was a losing battle. He knew he would never be safe from the remnants 
                of the IMC--and neither would his sister, Anita, as long as she was with him. So when he 
                was presumed dead in a ship explosion, he used that opportunity to leave his life behind, 
                even if it meant leaving her behind too.<br><br>
                Years later, “Lamont” moved to an idyllic little town called Harris Valley, where he fell 
                in love and got married. Harris Valley was so peaceful that they didn’t need law enforcement. 
                All they needed was their knight, Newcastle. But the knight had secrets of his own: Newcastle 
                had sold off the town to pay off his debts, and thugs from a gang called the Forgotten Families 
                came to collect. They killed Newcastle when he couldn’t pay, unaware that Lamont was watching. 
                He defeated them using his military acumen, but the Forgotten Families had plenty of reinforcements.<br><br>
                So Lamont came up with a dangerous solution. With Newcastle’s armor, he could take on his identity 
                and do what Newcastle could not: get into the Apex Games. With prize money like that, he could 
                definitely pay off the debts. But not without the risk of being discovered by his little sister,
